//Preceding load, is a useful technique in order to organize your etl, in layers in a "single" step
//it goes bottom up
//first step is to "Read" raw data
//second step you can perform a "clean up", specific column selection, transformation, calculations
//third step and onwards you can build further calculated columns, from the available information retrieved in step 2.
