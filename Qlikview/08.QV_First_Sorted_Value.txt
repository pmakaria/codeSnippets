//First sorted value
//returns the record that is sorted first, based on a field specified
//In case of multiple records for the same key, this would be useful to make a selection
//based on defined criteria (eg. get the most recent record, based on a date field).

//providing 1 as the rank value, returns the 1st sorted record (value n will return the nth record)
