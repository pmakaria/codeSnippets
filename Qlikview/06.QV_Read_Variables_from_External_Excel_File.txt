//Very useful code that reads a number of variables along with their expressions
//from an external excel file.
//This way the file can serve as a "library" of expressions, re-used in multiple applications
//No need to go through the application in order to modify logic used.
//check sample "variables" file "06.expressions.xlsx"


Variables:
LOAD Variable,
     Expression
FROM
